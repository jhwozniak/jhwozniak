## About me
I am an experienced banker, who for the past 18 years have been managing complex investment finance projects for large corporate clients. 
In October 2022 I decided to take a career break in order to study software development and combine it with my knowledge of finance. 
I have a strong interest in back-end, system design and databases. What really drives me is learning how modern software is organized and how it works under the hood of the user's interface.

- Project management

## Technology
- **Languages:** Java, Python (Flask), C#, C, SQL
- **Databases:** SQL Oracle Developer, SQLite, relational databases

## My projects
Check out some of my noteworthy projects:
### Harvard CS50 "Introduction to Computer Science":
- [Finance](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/finance) is a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. This tool allowed users to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it also let them buy and sell stocks by querying for stocks’ prices. The app was coded in Python (Flask, Jinja), HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It also uses Bootstrap for boosting the interface, SQLite for a database and API of IEX Cloud for checking actual stock prices.
- [Seven-day-average](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/seven-day-average) is an app in Python which is using a New York Times repository of live, cumulative COVID data to calculate new daily cases, create a 7-day average, and compare this week’s average to the previous week. During implementation it was interesting to learn how to read CSV files and how to practically use lists and dictionaries in Python.
- [The Family Clinic](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/project) is a web app facilitating work of an imaginary health clinic. It works in patients' as well as in doctors' mode. Tech: Python (Flask, Jinja), SQLite (relational databse), HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap. Online presentation of the project can be accessed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnTr_Kie560  
- [Homepage](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/homepage) is a simple homepage prepared with the use using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It contains several sub-pages and has some dynamic features like buttons, navigation bar and accordion made with the use of Bootstrap and JavaScript.
- [Speller](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/speller) is a program in C that spell-checks a text file, using a hash table. It required structuring an efficient hash table, dealing with pointers and avoiding memory leaks.
- [Filter](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/filter-less) is a desktop app written in C which required working out several algorithms to modify image files.
  
### Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology (PJATK) postgraduate studies "Information systems, software and databases":
- [Flower Shop](https://github.com/jhwozniak/PJATK/tree/main/WDP4_WJ_PD4135/src/zad3) is a desktop app in Java which facilitates purchase of flowers in a flower shop. It is a good practice in objected-oriented programming as it required me to structure classes using inheritance and to implement methods with the use of lists.
- [Writer/Reader](https://github.com/jhwozniak/PJATK/tree/main/WDP5_WJ_PD4135/src/zad2) is a desktop Java application which manages the process of executing multiple threads making operations on a data file. 
- [Anagrams](https://github.com/jhwozniak/PJATK/tree/main/PRA1_WJ_PD4135/src/zad3) is a Java application which loads words from a text file and finds their anagrams. A practical implementation of hash map with key-value pairs, with a value being a list of unique anagrams of a given word.
- [Simple Editor](https://github.com/jhwozniak/PJATK/tree/main/PRA2_WJ_PD4135/src/zad3) is a simple text editor in Java, in which you can create and edit own text file. It was developed with use of Java Swing as a frame for graphical interface.
- [Bookstore](https://github.com/jhwozniak/PJATK/tree/main/PRA3_WJ_PD4135/src/zad3) is a practical example of model-view-controller concept in Java. The program reads book records from a file, displays them using Java Swing in GUI and then accepts user's interactions like change in title, book's cover or price. The program required implementation of the AbstractTableModel interface.
- [Calculator](https://github.com/jhwozniak/PJATK/tree/main/PRA4_WJ_PD4135/src/zad1) is a short math calculator implemented in Java without the use of "ifs" or "switches". The user inputs two numbers and a required arithmetic operation in the command line. The program then searches a hash map for a matching key (arithmetic operation) and a value (a class implementing required interface).
- [Travel Office](https://github.com/jhwozniak/PJATK/tree/main/PRA5_WJ_PD4135/src/zad1) is a database application in Java simulating managing of travel offers by a travel office. The offers are loaded from external files, translated into chosen output languages, then inserted into database and finally displayed in GUI window. The project required practical use of OOP (different Java classes), object lists, relational database (SQLite) and GUI (Java Swing).
- [Students](https://github.com/jhwozniak/PJATK/tree/main/PJATK_App) is a .NET desktop application allowing to store and edit students' records. It was written in C# and uses MS SQL Server for database management and Windows Forms for graphical interface.
