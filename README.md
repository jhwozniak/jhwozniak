## About me
Im an experienced financier and banker, with strong analytical and interpersonal skills. For the past 18 years I have been managing complex investment finance projects for large corporate clients. 
In October 2022 I decided to take a career break in order to study IT and switch into software development. I have strong interest in backend development, systems design and databases. What really drives me is learning how modern software is organized and how it really works under the hood of the user's interface.
