In October 2022 I decided to take a career break in order to study software development and combine it with my knowledge of finance. 
I have a strong interest in back-end, system design and databases. What really drives me is learning how modern software is organized and how it works under the hood of the user's interface.

## My projects
Check out some of my noteworthy projects:
- [The Family Clinic](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/project) was a final project in Harvard CS50 "Introduction to Computer Science" course that I took in 2023.  The Family Clinic is a web app facilitating work of an imaginary health clinic. It works in patients' as well as in doctors' mode. Tech: Python (Flask, Jinja), SQLite, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap. Online presentation of the project can be accessed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnTr_Kie560  
- [Filter](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/filter-less) was one of the assignments of Harvard CS50 "Introduction to Computer Science". It was written in C and it required working out several algorithms which would modify image files.
- [Speller](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/speller) was one of the most difficult assignments of Harvard CS50 "Introduction to Computer Science". In this assignment students had to implement a program in that spell-checks a text file, using a hash table. It was written in C and it required structuring efficient hash table, dealing with pointers and avoiding memory leaks.
- [Homepage](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/homepage) was one of the assignments of Harvard CS50 "Introduction to Computer Science". It required students to prepare simple homepage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Specification required us to prepare several sub-pages and make it dynamic using Bootstrap and JavaScript.
- [Finance](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/finance) was one of the assignments of Harvard CS50 "Introduction to Computer Science". In this project I had to implement a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. This tool allowed users to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it also let them buy and sell stocks by querying for stocks’ prices. The app was coded in Python (Flask, Jinja), HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It also used Bootstrap for boosting the interface, SQLite for a database and API of IEX Cloud for checking actual stock prices.
- [Seven-day-average](https://github.com/jhwozniak/Harvard-CS50/tree/main/seven-day-average) was a side project which I voluntary did when taking Harvard CS50 "Introduction to Computer Science" course. In this project, I had to implement an app in Python which was using a New York Times repository of live, cumulative COVID data to calculate new daily cases, create a 7-day average, and compare this week’s average to the previous week. It was interesting to learn how to read CSV files and how to practically use lists and dictionaries in Python.
